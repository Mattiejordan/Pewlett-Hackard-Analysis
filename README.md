### **The Silver Tsunami Is Coming for Pewlett-Hackard**


* What's a Silver Tsunami?  This is an inevitable wave that occurs when one company has many employees arrive at retirement age at the same time.


Bobby and I performed this analysis for Pewlett-Hackard with ERD and SQL queries.
* From the list of current employees, aged 65 to 68, that are expected to retire very soon,
birth dates from 1952 to 1955, is a total of 72,458 employees. 

Pewlett-Hackard has suggested a Mentorship Program to help train 
new hires from their current employees born in 1965, age 55. 
This batch of mentors eligible is 1549 employees.

* The great Silver Tsunami are aged 60 to 64 and account to a total of *92,347* employees.
This great wave a much greater than the proposed amount of mentors available to help train new hires.


What will Pewlett-Hackard plan to do?
* I suggest increasing eligibility for mentorship to a wider range of employees.
If mentorship eligibility is expanded for employees aged 45 to 60. This range can offer a greater
force available to train the incoming new hires, as well as be prepared for a longer wave of mentoring years.
At this expanded range there are *93,756* employees available.
